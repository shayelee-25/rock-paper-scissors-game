# rock-paper-scissors-game

The main sections of code include writing the logic to get the computer choice, writing the logic to get the human choice, declare the players score variables, write the logic to play a single round, write the logic to play the entire game (5 rounds).

I started with building a blank html document and linking my external javascript page. In my javascript document I wrote out the assignment steps in a form of pseudocode to help me visually plan out what code needed to be wrote.

It took me several days to figure out the code for the game. I would get each function to work independently but not all together. Once I got them working together, I struggled to get it to play 5 rounds. I ended up turning some of the functions into variables and learned to use a "for" loop to achieve 5 rounds.
